- Dart is an ==open-source== ==general-purpose== programming language developed by Google.
- It ==supports== application development on both the ==client and server side==. 
- It is widely used for the development of Android apps, iOS apps, IoT(Internet of Things), and web applications using the [Flutter Framework](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flutter-an-introduction-to-the-open-source-sdk-by-google/).
- Syntactically, Dart bears a ==strong resemblance to Java, C, and JavaScript==.  
- It is a ==dynamic object-oriented language== with ==closure and lexical scope==. 
#### Why Use Dart
- **Fast & Smooth:** Dart ==compiles to native code== for speedy performance, ideal for mobile apps.
- **Easy to Learn:** Similar to familiar languages like Java or JavaScript, making it approachable for new developers.
- **Flutter Power:** Dart is the heart of Flutter, a popular framework for building beautiful and functional mobile apps.
- **One Code, Many Places:** Develop for mobile, web, and even desktop with a single code base (primarily with Flutter).
#### Basics
- The Dart SDK comes with its compiler – the **Dart VM** and a utility ==**dart2js**== which is meant for generating the **Javascript equivalent of a Dart Script** so that it can be run on those sites also which don’t support Dart.
- Dart is an **Object-oriented language** and is quite similar to that of Java Programming. 
- Dart is extensively used to create single-page websites and web applications. The best example of Dart application is Gmail.

#### Features
- Easy to Understand
- Object Oriented Programming
- Open Source
- Browser Support (because of dart2js)
- Type Safe (static and runtime checks for variable type)
- Flexible Compilation and Execution: Dart compilation supports both JIT (Just-in-Time) and AOT (Ahead-of-Time).
- Asynchronous Programming
